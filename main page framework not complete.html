        <h3>Georgia's History and Culture</h3>

        <p>Georgia is a southeastern state located in the US which is home to diverse landscapes and people. The culture is vibrant and each city within Georgia has its unqiue charm.<br>
           Georgia is home to various beaches, mountains, and forests. It is home to fans of southern traditions like farming, horsebackriding, and fishing.<br>
           It is also a sanctuary to those who enjoy nightclubs, concerts, and fine dining in various cities.The state has a tumultous history beginning with the violent colonization <br>
           of Native American (Also known as American Indian) land by Europeans. This colonization continued for over a century and during that time European colonialists<br>
           were also involved in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. This led Georgia to become the central cotton producer in the United States due to the labor <br>
           of Africans who were forced to be slaves. Following the Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, Georgia also became a trailblazer in the <br>
           Civil Rights Movement with many leaders like Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and Xernona Clayton changing Georgia, and subsequently the United States forever.<sup>[1]</sup>.
